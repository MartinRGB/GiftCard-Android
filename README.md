This is the Android version of [GifCard-Implementation](https://github.com/MartinRGB/GiftCard-Implementation)

##[Chuan²](https://dribbble.com/woodmouse) did a masterpiece 

I love [Chuan²](https://dribbble.com/woodmouse)'s work,it's simple & elegant.
You can see the impressive [animation on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2045026-Gift-Card?list=searches&offset=0)

##Why I Do This?

As a motion designer（[My Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/MartinRGB)）,I begin to learn some code,try to work with both Xcode and Facebook Origami.

Also I thought beautiful things should be implemented.

##Final Effect

I try to Implement this work in Android Studio(First of all,I made a prototype in Origami).I used the Rebound framework.

Sorry for my poor code skill.I just wanna explore more ways to Implement effect.(Not only live in design tools)
